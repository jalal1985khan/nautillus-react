<h1 className="mb-4 mt-5 heading">Ship Agency & Logistics</h1>
<p className="fs-4 mt-4">We deliver a range of port agency, marine, and logistics services through a robust partner network. From pre-arrival to post-departure, our operational personnel pay close attention to accurate and speedy communication in handling overall disbursement control. We leverage our experience to ensure that vessels enter and exit ports quickly with all port services taken care of in an efficient manner.</p>
<p className="fs-4">We understand the importance of a qualified crew that is at the forefront of all activities and is the key to a vessel’s safe and smooth day-to-day operation. In addition, safeguarding the vessel’s and the owner’s interests requires highly efficient utilization of crew. Through our own crewing offices in Chennai, Goa, Mumbai and, Kochi, we maintain one of India’s largest pools of qualified, motivated and, dedicated seafarers that fulfill these needs efficiently.</p>
<p className="fs-4">We offer crew supply services for all types of vessels. By using modern search and selection methods we ensure that our employees not only have the required professional qualifications but also have the right outlook and personality required for the job. Our crew management services include recruitment, selection, training, and management of officers and cadets and rating them for suitability and deployment for different vessels.</p>

Nautilus shipping has one of the highest crew happiness and work satisfaction figures because we are able to provide back to back contracts and career development opportunities.
